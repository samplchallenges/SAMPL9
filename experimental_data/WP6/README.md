# Experimental results

Of the files here, the ChemDraw and Word files were provided by Lyle Isaacs on 2021-07-27 and are the source data. The csv file was derived from these.

## pKa values for WP6

We added pKa values for WP6, which Lyle Isaacs had measured by a CRO. He notes from the report (provided here):
>  It appears [the pKa values] are not of the highest quality.  The values determined are 3.52, 3.62, 4.16, 4.41, 4.80, 5.66.  It is assumed that the two portals of WP6 act independently (e.g. each pKa actually represents 2 deprotonation steps).  The most important thing is seen on page 8 of the report where it is shown that more than 95% of the CO2H groups are deprotonated to CO2- at pH 7.4
