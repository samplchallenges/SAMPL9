# The SAMPL9 Blind Prediction Challenges for Computational Chemistry

Challenge details, inputs, and results from the SAMPL9 series (phase) of challenges. Each individual SAMPL9 challenge may be broken up into multiple stages.

See the [SAMPL website](https://samplchallenges.github.io/) for information on the Statistical Assessement of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) series of challenges as a whole. This repository focuses specifically on the SAMPL9 series of challenges. Additionally, see the [SAMPL community](https://zenodo.org/communities/sampl/?page=1&size=20) on Zenodo for content related to the SAMPL series of challenges. If you wish to use Zenodo to post our presentation slides, datasets, and/or other SAMPL related material, and get a DOI for them, please upload to the community [here](https://zenodo.org/communities/sampl/?page=1&size=20) so that your content will be listed.

Because these files are available publicly, we have no record of who downloads them. Therefore, you should sign up for notifications. Specifically, if you want to receive updates if we uncover any problems, it is imperative that you either (a) [sign up for the SAMPL e-mail list](https://eepurl.com/dPj11j), or (b) sign up for notifications of changes to this GitHub repository (the Watch button, above); ideally you would do both.

Please note that some aspects of the SAMPL8 series of challenges are still ongoing, but as we are launching a new host-guest challenge that marks the beginning of the SAMPL9 series of challenges, so we have opened up this repository.

## Acknowledging and citing SAMPL

If you've benefitted from our work on the SAMPL series of challenges, please be sure to acknowledge our SAMPL NIH grant in any publications/presentations. This funded host-guest experiments, as well as our work organizing and administrating these challenges. You may acknowledge SAMPL by saying something like, "We appreciate the National Institutes of Health for its support of the SAMPL project via R01GM124270 to David L. Mobley (UC Irvine)."

We also ask you to cite the SAMPL dataset(s) you used. You may cite the sets by their DOI, which is available here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/397390406.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/397390406)


Of course, we also appreciate it if you cite any overview/experimental papers relevant to the particular SAMPL challenge you participated in.

## Challenge construction

### Overview

The SAMPL9 phase of challenges includes a new host-guest challenge (WP6) that closed November 15, 2021, and a bCD host-guest challenge..


### The WP6 challenge

The WP6 challenge focuses on binding of WP6 to thirteen guests. Binding has been experimentally characterized, and the Isaacs group is preparing a paper for publication. Experimental results/data will be available after the challenge closes.

**Deadline**: The deadline for WP6 submissions was November 15, 2021. [The submission format is available here](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL9/blob/main/host_guest/WP6/WP6_submissions.txt).

### The bCD-Phenothiazine-based drugs challenge

The bCD challenge focuses on binding of five phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs to two hosts in the cyclodextrin family. Experimental binding affinity measurements have been measured, and the Gilson group is preparing a publication for this work. Experimental results/data will be available after the challenge closes.  

**Deadline**: The deadline for bCD submissions is Feb. 23, 2022. [The submission format is available here](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL9/blob/main/host_guest/bCD/bCD_submissions.txt).
