# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL9-XX` (e.g. SAMPL9-1, SAMPL9-2, etc).
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please note SMILES strings of microstates you used in your submission, such as in the methods section.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
Structures were optimized at B3LYP/def2-SVP level of theory using 3D structure generated from provided SMILES strings. 
The structures were optimized in both solvents with the SMD implicit solvation model. The structures were verified to be local minina with no imaginary frequencies.
Thermal free energy corrections at 298.15 K were obtained with harmonic frequencies scaled by 1.0044 to account for anharmonicity.
DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-SVP calculations were performed on the optimized structures.
The RIJCOSX approximation and the corresponding auxiliary basis sets (def2/J, def2-SVP/C) were used under TightPNO convergence thresholds.
A vertical solvation model was used to compute the logP based on the difference in the solvation free energies of the molecules in toluene and water.
Both the standard error of the mean and the model were reported to 0.01 based on submission criteria.
In the method for the submission, true error would be 0 since only one QM calculation was completed per challenge molecule.

# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
