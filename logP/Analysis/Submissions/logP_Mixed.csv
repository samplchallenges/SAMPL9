Method:
DFT-optimized structures (RI-B3LYP/def2-SVP) using 3D structure generated from provided SMILES strings were used as inputs to generate the topology files for the challenge molecules and toluene using CGenFF and CHARMM-GUI. 
The TIP4P potential for water was used for all aqueous simulations.
Each challenge molecule was placed in a 3 x 3 x 3 nm box and then solvated. 
For toluene solutions, approximately 152 toluene molecules were placed in the box and equilibrated to represent the concentration of toluene in toluene in a 27 cubic nanometer box.
For aqueous solutions, approximately 900 water molecules were placed in the box to represent the density of water.
Once the boxes were created, 499 frames were extracted from a 4 ns NVT simulation.
With the 499 frames, the solvation free energy of the challenge molecule was computed in ORCA using the B97-3c method with an implicit solvent model of toluene and water, which were used to generate a grid of 249001 possible logP values using Python.
Based on the histogram of computed logP values at the B97-3c level, multimodal distributions resulted in population-based weighting of each distribution.
Exploratory data analysis was done in Python using the RDKit and scikit-learn packages to identify and confirm potential clusters of structures based on 3D descriptors.
For each cluster/distribuion of logP values, five frames in water and five frames in toluene that yielded a logP value around the mean of the distribution were selected. 
For selected frames, B3LYP/def2-TZVP def2-TZVP/C RIJCOSX gas phase frequency calculations were performed. 
The structures were not optimized to a local minima since the frames were selected from MD simulations.
Thermal free energy corrections at 298.15 K were obtained with harmonic frequencies scaled by 1.0044 to account for anharmonicity.
Solvation free energy calculations were performed at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP level of theory with the RIJCOSX approximation and the corresponding auxiliary basis set (def2-TZVP/C).
Solvated energies were computed and the logP was calculated using a vertical solvation approach that calculates logP from the solvation free energies of the challenge molecules in toluene and water.
In the cases of SAMPL9-11, SAMPL9-14, and SAMPL9-15, multimodal distributions were observed, thus to report the logP mean and standard error, a weighted average and an inverse variance weighted standard error was applied. 
For all other challenge molecules, the mean and standard error of the logP values of the five frames were used to calculate the logP.
This method was done with major contributions from Jonathan Dannatt (University of Dallas) and Asa Waterman (University of Dallas)
