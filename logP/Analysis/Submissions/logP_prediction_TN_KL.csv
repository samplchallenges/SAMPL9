# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to toluene (ΔG_toluene - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 16 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL9-XX` (e.g. SAMPL9-1, SAMPL9-2, etc).
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please note SMILES strings of microstates you used in your submission, such as in the methods section.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
The Conductor like Screening Model for Realistic Solvation (COSMO-RS) approached was used.
Initially, we used RDkit to obtain the xyz structures of SAMPL9 molecules based on the SMILES strings.
Next, we performed conformational search using the COSMOconf procedure at BP86/def2-TZVPD level of theory with the FINE COSMO cavity.
Finally, we predicted the transfer free energies using COSMOtherm based on the difference of the chemical potential at infinite dilution in phases toluene and water.
COSMO-RS has a statistical noise smaller than 0.1 kcal/mol on average (J. Warnau et al., J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des., vol. 35, no. 7, pp. 813–818, Jul. 2021).
COSMO-RS predicts the transfer free energy with an uncertainty of 0.4 kcal/mol (T. M. Letcher, ‘Development and Applications in Solubility’. The Royal Society of Chemistry, 02 2007).
