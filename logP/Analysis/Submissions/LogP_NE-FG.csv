Method:
Force field for solute is GAFF2 with AM1-BCC charges (generated with
PrimaDORAC www1.chim.unifi.it/orac/primadorac); Starting
nonequilibrium state is prepared by combining 96 configurations of the
gas-phase solute sampled with Hamiltonian Replica Exchange (minimum
scaling factor 0.1 -> T=3000 K) combined with 96 configuration of pure
solvent in standard conditions (NPT). Gas-phase HREM simulations were
run for 8 ns. MD simulations of pure solvent were run for 5 ns.
Solute molecules are in their neutral state. For the solvent, we used
343 Toluene molecules in a cubic box (GAFF2-AM1-BCC) with a mean
side-length of 39.72 Angs and 1728 OPC3 water molecules in a cubic box
with a mean side-length of 37.45 Angs. In the 100 NE alchemy runs, the
initially decoupled solute was recoupled in the solvent (NPT
condition) in 450 ps. The solvation free energies DG_w and DG_t are
evaluated using the Gaussian estimate if the p-value of the
Anderson-Darling test of the work distribution is greater than 50% or
with the Jarzynski estimate DG=-RT ln(e^{-\beta W} with bias estimated
from the variance. Errors (confidence interval 95%) are computed with
bootstrap with resampling. The Toluene-water partition coefficient is
computed as LogTW= -(DG_t -DG_w )/RT/log(10).  The water to toluene
transfer free energy is DG_t - DG_w.  Calculation were done on the
ENEA-CRESCO6 cluster in Portici (NA), Italy using the program ORAC
(www1.chim.unifi.it/orac ). Wall-clock time for a full LogTW
calculation, on a per solute basis, was ~ 1.5 hour using 12 48-cores
nodes (Skylake Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8160 2.10GHz).
