Method:
Free energies of transfer from water to toluene were calculated using ``double-decoupling'': alchemical free energies of decoupling a solute's nonbonded interactions were calculated for aqueous solvent and in toluene, with the transfer free energy calculated as the difference between the two values.  The free energies were computed using expanded-ensemble molecular simulations performed in GROMACS \cite{abraham2015gromacs} on the Folding@home distributed computing platform \cite{zimmerman2021sars}.  A three-part workflow was implemented to (1) prepare simulation topologies, (2) equilibrate, optimize and perform expanded ensemble simulations, and (3) analyze the results.
\subsection{System preparation}
\paragraph{Preparation of system topologies}
The OpenEye OEChem, Omega and Quacpac \cite{QUACPAC} modules were used to generate low-energy conformers of solutes and assign partial charges using the AM1-BCC method \cite{jakalian2000fast}.  Separate topologies were constructed for all likely tautomers and relevant ionization states (those with significant population at pH 7.0 in the aqueous phase), allowing for estimation of distribution coefficients ($\log D$) as well as partition coefficients ($\log P$).
Force field parameters for all solutes and toluene solvent were provided by OpenFF-2.0.0. \cite{boothroyd2022development} The Open Force Field Toolkit \cite{jeff_wagner_2023_7506404} and the \textit{parmed} library \cite{shirts2017lessons} were used to parameterize each molecule and create structure and topology files for use with the GROMACS \cite{abraham2015gromacs} molecular dynamics package.
\paragraph{Molecular simulation}
All simulations were performed using GROMACS 2020.3. Solutes were solvated in an initial cubic box of length 6.0 nm, by insertion into pre-constructed periodic solvent systems and removal overlapping solvent molecules, through the GROMACS \texttt{gmx solvate} command.  Aqueous systems used a periodic box containing 216 TIP3P \cite{jorgensen1983comparison} water molecules provided by GROMACS for this purpose, while toluene-solvated systems required custom preparation of a periodic box containing 216 toluene molecules.  This system was steepest-descent minimized and pressure-equilibrated for 200 ps using a Berendsen barostat at 298.15 K, converging to a final cubic box length of 3.3806 nm.
Solvated solute systems with an initial volume of (6.0 nm)$^3$ of were prepared for production using the following procedure: (1) steepest-descent minimization, (2) constant-volume equilibration at 298.15 K using a velocity-rescaling thermostat for 100 ps, and (3) constant-pressure equilibration at 1 bar using a Berendsen barostat for 200 ps.  For charged solutes, counterions (either Na+ or Cl- with parameters from the AMBER force field) were added at a distance of 4.6 nm from the center of mass of the solute.  The distance was enforced using harmonic position restraints of force constant 1000 kJ mol$^{-1}$ on the ion and a single non-hydrogen atom of the solute.  Ions were added to the solute molecule topology, such that non-bonded scaling of the solute and its counterion(s) would occur commensurately. All molecular dynamics used a velocity-Verlet integrator with a 2-fs time step, with hydrogen bond lengths constrained using LINCS \cite{hess1997lincs}. Particle-Mesh Ewald electrostatics were used with a PME order of 4 and Fourier spacing of 0.16.

\subsection{Expanded Ensemble simulations}
Free energies of solute decoupling were obtained using expanded-ensemble (EE) simulations performed using the free energy methods available in GROMACS 2020.3.  In an EE simulation, $N$ thermodynamic ensembles corresponding to alchemical intermediates are adaptively sampled through proposed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) moves.  A bias potential $\tilde{f}_i$ for each intermediate $i$ is maintained and adaptively adjusted to produce equal sampling of all intermediates. By detailed balance, the converged values of $\tilde{f}_i$ that achieve this goal are equal to the free energies $f_i$ of each thermodynamic ensemble, and the total free energy of the alchemical transformation from $i=1$ to $i=N$ can be computed as $\Delta G = \tilde{f}_N -\tilde{f}_1$.
Expanded ensemble methods have been used to predict absolute binding free energies in host-guest systems \cite{monroe2014converging,rizzi2020sampl6}, and relative binding free energies for receptor ligand systems \cite{zhang2021expanded}.  An advantage of EE is the abilility to sample all alchemical intermediates in a single simulation, enabling asynchronous deployment of large numbers of calculations.  A key shortcoming, however, is the difficulty in determining a schedule of alchemical intermediates that will have sufficiently large MCMC acceptance probabilities to enable efficient sampling.
To address this problem, we have developed a new method to optimize the schedule of decoupling parameters $\lambda_i^{\text{(coul)}}$ and $\lambda_i^{\text{(vdw)}}$ for the Couloub and van der Waals interactions, respectively, by assuming a simple model of how the variance of $\big( \frac{dU}{d\lambda} \big)$ increases with $\lambda$ (Zhang et al., in preparation).   This method takes as input energies sampled in a short EE simulation with an initial $\lambda$-schedule, and outputs a new set of near-optimal $\lambda_i$ values that maximize the MCMC acceptance probabilities, for use in production simulations.
We chose 99 alchemical intermediates for solute decoupling, where first the electrostatic interactions are scaled to zero, then the van der Waals interactions are scaled to zero.  For optimization of the $\lambda$-values, 1000 ps of EE simulation was performed (in some cases more; enough to sample all intermediates), restricting proposed MCMC moves to nearest-neighbor thermodynamic ensembles, to ensure sampling of each ensemble.
Production runs with optimized $\lambda$-values were performed on the Folding@home distributed computing. For each system, 100 EE simulation replicas were performed used a timestep of 2 fs, 0.9 nm cutoffs for long-range electrostatics, LINCS constraints on H-bonds, with frames were saved every 50 ps.  A Metropolized-Gibbs move set was used for proposed MCMC moves. The EE biases were adjusted using the Wang-Landau flat-histogram method \cite{wang2001efficient}. The initial Wang-Landau (WL) bias increment was set to 10 $k_BT$, and was scaled by a factor of 0.8 every time the histogram of sampled intermediates was sufficiently flat.
\subsection{Analysis of free energies and uncertainties}
The convergence of the EE simulations was monitored by the progressive decrease of the Wang-Landau (WL) increment.  In practice, EE simulations are sufficiently converged when the WL increment decreases below 0.01.  Typical trajectory lengths to achieve this convergence range from 500--1000 ns.  Only some of the submitted trajectories were able to reach these lengths, due to the asynchronous client-server architecture of distributed computing.
For each system, estimates of the free energy of decoupling were made by averaging across the available replicas.  For each replica $j$, the last half of the trajectory of $\Delta G$ estimates was used to compute a sample mean $\bar{\Delta G_j}$ and variance $\sigma^2_{\Delta G_j}$.  The aggregate estimate for a system's $\Delta G$ was computed as the $1/\sigma^2_{\Delta G_j}$-weighted average of  $\bar{\Delta G_j}$ values.  This estimator gives the largest influence to the most converged EE simulations.
\subsection{Predictions of $\log P_{\text{tol/w}}$}
Our final submission of predictions are computed as $\log P_{\text{tol/w}} = \log_{10} (e^{-\Delta G})$, for
\begin{equation}
    \Delta G = \Delta G_{\text{w}} - \Delta G_{\text{tol}}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta G_{\text{w}}$ is the free energy of decoupling the solute from water, and $\Delta G_{\text{tol}}$ is the free energy of decoupling the solute from toluene (both in units $RT$).  Analytic propagation of error is used to estimate uncertainties for these values.
For all solutes except albendazole, we compute transfer free energies that only consider the neutral (and non-zwitterionic) species.  For albendazole, there are two tautomers predicted to have significant population in both aqueous and toluene phases.  A recent DFT study by Claramunt et al. \cite{claramunt2022determination} estimates  tautomer (``2'') to be preferred in aqueous solution over tautomer ``1'' by $\Delta G^* = -0.7$ kJ mol$^{-1}$.  In this case, we estimate the free energy of transfer as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta G =  -\ln \frac{ 1 + e^{-\Delta G_i} }{\sum_{i \in \text{unbound}} e^{-\Delta G_i} },
\end{equation}
where each $\Delta G_i$ are bound- and unbound-microstate
Model uncertainties $\sigma_{\text{model}}$ were calculated as
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\text{model}} = \left( \sigma_{\Delta G}^2 +  \sigma_{\text{sys}}^2  \right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\text{sys}} = 0.6857 RT$ is assumed to be independent systematic error arising from the reported 1.7 kJ mol$^{-1}$ accuracy of OpenFF 2.0.0 \cite{boothroyd2022development}.
