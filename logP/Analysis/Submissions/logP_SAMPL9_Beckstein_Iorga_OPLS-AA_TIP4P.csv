# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to toluene (ΔG_toluene - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 16 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL9-XX` (e.g. SAMPL9-1, SAMPL9-2, etc).
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please note SMILES strings of microstates you used in your submission, such as in the methods section.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
Alchemical free energy calculations were performed in explicit
solvent, following the protocol described in [1-3].  Parameters were generated with the
OPLS-AA mol2ff software (B.I. Iorga, unpublished; also used in [1-3]) for
OPLS-AA with the TIP4P water model. Files were prepared for Gromacs
2020.3. Autocorrelation analysis and the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR)
were performed with the alchemlyb Python package (https://github.com/alchemistry/alchemlyb),
release 1.0.1 as integrated into MDPOW. Errors are reported as errors of the mean (see [1-3]). The
model uncertainty was estimated on the basis of the results from [2].
