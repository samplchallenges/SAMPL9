Method:
This work follows our SAMPL6 entry, UFZ-LSER. Namely, Abraham solute descriptors 
were predicted from the provided smiles on the UFZ-LSER website (https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=31698&contentonly=1&m=0&lserd_data[mvc]=Public/start).
Once Abraham solute descriptors were predicted for the SAMPL9 molecules,
existing LSER correlations were used to predict logP, which we converted
to the transfer free energy in kcal/mol.

The uncertainty in the solvation free energy calculations was taken to be 0.1 kcal/mol. Given the
same SMILES, we would obtain the same Abraham solute descriptors, which would lead to 
an uncertainty of 0. We use 0.1 as the server requires a non-zero value. To obtain the model uncertainty,
we additionally performed calculation using an existing correlation for water/1-octanol 
which were used to generate an estimate of logP octanol/water and the transfer free energy. 
This was then compared to reference logP values obtained from DrugBank.ca, which were converted to transfer free energies.
