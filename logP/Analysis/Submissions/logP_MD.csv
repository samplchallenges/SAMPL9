Method:
DFT-optimized structures (RI-B3LYP/def2-SVP) using 3D structure generated from provided SMILES strings were used as inputs to generate the topology files for the challenge molecules and toluene using CGenFF and CHARMM-GUI. 
The TIP4P potential for water was used for all aqueous simulations.
Each challenge molecule was placed in a 3 x 3 x 3 nm box and then solvated. 
For toluene solutions, approximately 152 toluene molecules were placed in the box and equilibrated to represent the concentration of toluene in toluene in a 27 cubic nanometer box.
For aqueous solutions, approximately 900 water molecules were placed in the box to represent the density of water.
Once the cubic boxes were created, an accelerated weighted histogram method was used with 12 lambda points to determine the free energy of solvation of the challenge molecule to the respective solution. 
The simulation ran from 2-4 ns based on convergence of the solvation free energies (difference in lambda points at the final timestep).
The simulations were run in triplicate to generate a standard error of the model.
The solvation free energies in each solvent were then used to compute the logP based on a vertical solvation model (differences in solvation free energies).
