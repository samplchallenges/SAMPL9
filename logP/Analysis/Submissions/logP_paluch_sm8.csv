Computing and hardware:
All electronic structure calculations were performed on the Pitzer Cluster at the Ohio Supercomputer Center 
(https://www.osc.edu/resources/technical_support/supercomputers/pitzer). 
The reported compute time is taken as the walltime times the number of processors (core hours). 
All of the electronic structure calculations used 20 cores.
Pitzer has a mix of processors. We did not specify the processor type upon submission, so a mix was used.  
The original Pitzer cluster was installed in late 2018 and is a Dell-built, Intel Xeon Skylake processor-based supercomputer with 260 nodes.
In September 2020, OSC installed an additional 398 Intel Xeon Cascade Lake processor-based 
nodes as part of a Pitzer Expansion cluster.

Method:
Solvation free energy calculations were performed using electronic structure calculations using the SM8 continuum
solvation model in water and toluene. All calculations were performed using QChem/5.4.2.
Single point energy calculations were all performed at the M062X/6-31G* level of theory/basis in water and toluene.

Starting with the SMILES provided by the challenge organizers, for each molecule we generated up to 50 low energy
conformations using Frog2 (https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/Frog2/), which were minimized
using the AMMOS force field. All of the conformations were generated using the free online server.

We then took the structures as generated by Frog2 and performed the necessary single point energy 
calculations in SM8 water and toluene using QChem/5.4.2. In each solvent QChem reports the 
free energy. Using all possible conformations, the computed energies were Boltzmann-weighted to obtain
an estimate of the free energy in each solvent, which was subsequently used to compute the transfer free energy.

By avoiding geometry optimizations using electronic structure calculations, the calculations were extremely
efficient.

The uncertainty in the solvation free energy calculations was taken to be 0.5 kcal/mol. Given a fixed geometry,
the computed single point energy calculations should remain unchanged. The error estimate is due to generation
of conformations. To obtain the model uncertainty,
we additionally performed calculation in 1-octanol which were used to generate an estimate of
logP octanol/water and the transfer free energy. This was then compared to reference logP values
obtained from DrugBank.ca, which were converted to transfer free energies. The large error is driven
by the error in molecule 11.
