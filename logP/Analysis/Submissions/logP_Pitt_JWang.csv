# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit water to octanol (ΔG_octanol - ΔG_water) transfer free energy (TFE) predictions for all 22 molecules.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# The energy units must be in kcal/mol.

# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL9-XX` (e.g. SAMPL9-1, SAMPL9-2, etc).
# Please report TFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and TFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, TFE, TFE SEM, TFE model uncertainty
#
# If you use a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate, please note SMILES strings of microstates you used in your submission, such as in the methods section.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

physical (MM)

# METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details.
# Level of details should be roughly equivalent to that used in a publication.
# Please include the values of key parameters with units.
# Please explain how statistical uncertainties were estimated.
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, please report their SMILES strings and populations of all the microstates in this section.
# If you used a microstate other than the challenge provided microstate (`SMXX_micro000`), please list your chosen `Molecule ID` (in the form of `SMXX_extra001`) along with the SMILES string in your methods description.
#
# Use as many lines of text as you need.

Method:
QM geometry optimizations were performed on each molecule (not necessary); The Antechamber module in AMBER Tools was adopted to perform MM geometry optimizations and generate the partial atomic charges using the ABCG2 charge model; MM/PBSA calculations of the solvation free energies in water and in toluene were carried out on the single conformation of each solute from previous steps of MM geometry optimization and partial charge generation.

# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
Ranked:
True
