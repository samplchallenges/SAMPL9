# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal but informative name of the method used.
# The name must not exceed 40 characters.
# The 'Name:' keyword is required as shown here.
Name:

#
# COMPUTE TIME SECTION
#
# Please provide the average compute time across all of the molecules.
# For physical methods, report the GPU and/or CPU compute time in hours.
# For empirical methods, report the query time in hours.
# Create a new line for each processor type.
# The 'Compute time:' keyword is required as shown here.
Compute time:
The conformer COSMO file creation took ~40 hours (wall time) using 1 to 48 processors. 
The number of processors used changes in the course of the calculations.

#
# COMPUTING AND HARDWARE SECTION
#
# Please provide details of the computing resources that were used to train models and make predictions.
# Please specify compute time for training models and querying separately for empirical prediction methods.
# Provide a detailed description of the hardware used to run the simulations.
# The 'Computing and hardware:' keyword is required as shown here.
Computing and hardware:
For the conformer generation we have used a linux machine (AMD EPYC 7413 24-Core Processor). The calculations could use up to 48 cores. The number of actually used CPU differ during the steps of the conformer search procedure.
Compared to the creation of the conformer sets the time for the COSMO-RS logD calculations is neglectable (one minute on a windows notebook, one CPU).

Method:
Conformer/tautomer workflow:
1) We used COSMOquick + xTB approach to generate possible tautomers. After a first DFT optimization we discarded all structures with relative energies >15 kcal/mol. The tautomer sets were then checked manually and missing tautomers were added.
2) COSMOconf was used to create the COSMO files for the conformer set of the microstates.
COSMO-RS calculations:
All COSMO-RS calculation have been performed with the COSMOtherm software (parametrization: BP_TZVPD_FINE_23.ctd). 
The COSMO files for Water, Toluene, SAMPL9-10, SAMPL9-11, SAMPL9-15, SAMPL9-9, SAMPL9_12 and SAMPL9_4 have been taken from the COSMObase2023, all other files were calculated according to the procedure described above (step 1+2) 
The conformer sets of the microstates (tautomers) of the compounds have been merged to form the conformer set of the compound. These sets have been used for the prediction of the partition coefficients between pure water and a toluene phase with 0.23 mol % water (N. Peschke, S. I. Sandler,  J. Chem. Eng. Data 1995, 40, 315-320).
The COSMO-RS algorithm by itself has no statistical error. The overall workflow including the conformational search (or molecule or state) has a statistical noise smaller than 0.1 kcal/mol.
As an error estimation for the underlying partition coefficients we use the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.4 kcal/mol (taken from COSMO-RS parametrization).
