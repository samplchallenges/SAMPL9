## LogP experimental values

### Manifest

- `measurements_final.csv`: Contains final measured values for the logP experiments, from William Zamora, Clara RÃ fols, and Rebecca Ruiz. The `new_logPexp_reviewed` column contains final values after repeated measurements and re-verification; the other column contains initial draft values. The former (final) column is the one which will be reported in the experimental paper and used in analysis. (Provided 2023-02-06 by William Zamora)


Experimental work was subsequently [published in a study in PCCP](https://dx.doi.org/10.1039.D3CP01428B)
