# The SAMPL9 WP6 challenge

The WP6 challenge focuses on binding of WP6 to thirteen ammonium/diammonium cationic guests. Experimental binding measurements have been collected and the Isaacs group is preparing a paper for publication. Experimental details will be provided shortly. 

Our deadline for this challenge will be posted in the top-level [README.md](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL9/blob/master/README.MD#the-wp6-challenge)

## More on the host

This host-guest series is based on a pillar[n]arene host known as WP6, yet to be featured in a previous SAMPL challenge. WP6 similar to cucurbit[n]urils, application based. Structurally, WP6 contains CH2 linkers connecting the phenylene groups, and each phenylene group contains two anionic functional group arms. Background information on WP6 may be found in a number of publications including DOI [insert DOIs HERE]

## Experimental conditions

All ITC experiments were conducted in phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) at pH 7.40 and at 298.15 K. [NEED TO INPUT CONCENTRATION]

## Disclaimers

Note that we have typically selected, or attempted to select, reasonable protonation states and conformers of the hosts and guests, but these may be controversial, uncertian, or change upon binding, so participants are encouraged to exercise care in selectin gwhich states are modeled. Typically selection of protonation states, tautomers and conformers is one major place where particpant protocols differ and lead to different downstream results.
