Method:

All calculation were performed with the smina code (dowloaded as a static executable from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/). The host and guest PDB structures were taken from the
github site with no change of the protonation state. For the WP6, the pKa of WP6 are estimated from
the statistical factor formula [D. D. Perrin, Boyd Dempsey and E. P. Serjeant. (1981). Molecular
Factors that Modify pKa Values. In pKa Prediction for Organic Acids and Bases
(16â€“17). Netherlands:Springer ]:

pka(n) = pka(1) - log((n)/(13-n))

Where pka(1) is the pka of the template monobasic acid 2-(2,5-dimethylphenoxy) acetic acid with
canonical SMILES: CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)C)OCC(=O)O. Assuming that pKa(1)=3.23 (Scifinder, predicted value),
we obtain that, at pH=7.4, the prevalent species is the 12- anion with all deprotonated group (
97\%).  We converted the host and guest PDB structures to PDBQT format using the MGLTOOLS python
utilities ( http://mgltools.scripps.edu/ ) prepare_ligand4.py and prepare_receptor4.py

Smina Free energies were computed using the bash commands:

for i in G* ; do\
    smina -r WP6.pdbqt -l $i.pdbqt --center_x 0.0 --center_y 0.0 --center_z 0.0 --size_x 12.0 --size_y 12.0 --size_z 12.0 --scoring vinardo -o $i.out\
done

Blind predictions were computed using  the best smina docking scores in the G??.out files -in all cases consisting in no less than 8 nearly degenerate DGk  - assuming that DG = -RT log(sum_k e^-{\beta DG_i/RT}). To this end,  we used the bash commmand:

for i in G*.out ; do printf $i " "; awk '{if(NF==4 && $2 ~ "[0-9]*.[0-9]" ) print}' $i | awk '{sume+=exp(-$2/0.596)}END{printf "%8.2f\n",  -0.596*log(sume)}' ; done  > vinardo_prediction


Nota Bene: the smina/vinardo was tested on the following complexes with known association constant:

WP6- G13            DG=-8.48    https://doi.org/10.3390/polym9120719
WP6-Methylene-Blue  DG= -9.68   https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/cc/c8cc02739k
WP6-M1              DG= -8.37   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142521000317
WP6-M2              DG= -10.59   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142521000317
WP6-choline         DG= -6.48    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400517315708
WP6-Betaine          no binding  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400517315708

yielding
Pearson=0.88; a= 0.71; b= 2.18; MUE=0.87; tau=0.86; MSE=-0.07

The whole calculation was completed in few seconds on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700 CPU @ 3.60GHz with no GPU.
Pretty frustrating,  indeed.

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Alchemical`, `Quantum`, `Other Physical` `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Empirical
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
