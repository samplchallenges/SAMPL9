# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.

Method:
Binding poses of host molecules were obtained using induced fit docking using MOE Software. The selected
poses were prepared using tleap module of AmberTools20. gaff2 and TIP4PEW were used for host-guest molecules and water, respectively.
25nM NaCl was used as counter ions instead of sodium phosphate, as described here:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00359).
Each complex was simulated for 20ns using pmemd.cuda as implemented in Amber20, and the whole trajectory was used for MM-GBSA binding
energy calculation. For each compound, a second set of simulation was also performed by starting with different initial
velocities. For MM-GBSA binding energy calculation, every 10 frame from 10000 frames were picked, and the average
energy of two duplicae simulations were reported. 

Initial structures of host, guest molecules were protonated using Protonate3D method 
implemented in Molecular Operating Environment(MOE) v2019. Complex structures were 
generated by docking guest molecules in to the binding cavity of the host using general 
docking followed by a amber10:EHT minimization in MOE. All systems were prepared using 
gaff2 and TIP4P-EW force fields and they were neutralized to mimic the ionic strength of 
 the experimental conditions using Na+ and Cl- ions using parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614). 
In all simulations, Lanevin thermostat has been used for temepreture, and pressure is coupled to 
1 atm using isotropic position scaling. The systems were relaxed with restraints on the host-guest 
systems(100 and 50 kcal/mol), only on the guest (10 kcal/mol) and no restraints. Each step was 20000 
steps with NVT conditions. Heating the systems was performed in a ten-step procedure from 0 K to 300 K. 
First, all atoms  were restrained (3 kcal/mol) for 160 ps until 20 K. Then, only the heavy atoms 
except for the solvent and ions were kept restrained (3 kcal/mol) for 250 ps until temperature reaches 
200 K. Finally, all restraints were removed and the temperature inreased up to 300 K in three steps for 
1100 ps in total. Before the producion step, the systems were equilibrated at 300 K for 0.5 ns using NPT. 
Non-bonded interactions were truncated with 12 angstrom cutoff, whereas long range electrostatic 
interactions were calculated with Particle Mesh Ewald. Hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE algorithm. 
The production runs were performed with 1 fs time-step and he length of the simulations were 50 ns. 
The simulations were performed using pmemd.cuda module.
