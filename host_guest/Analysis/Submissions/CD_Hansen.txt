Method:
All simulations were conducted with the GROMACS 2016.4 program patched to the
free-energy library PLUMED 2.4.2 for restraints definition. 
The binding free energies were obtained by decoupling the cyclodextrin 
host from its environment both in the complexed state and free in 
solution using 28 or 24 intermediate lambda states with sampling 
times of 20 ns per intermediate state. During decoupling 
in the complexed state a set of 6 restraints was activated 
to keep the complex together. The free-energy contribution 
from these restraints was calculated analytically. 

Production simulations were run in the NPT ensemble, with temperature control
using a Nose-Hoover thermostat with relaxation time of 1.0 ps^-1
and Parrinello-Rahman barostat with coupling constant tau_p = 2.0 ps. 
A Verlet-buffered neighbor list which was updated every 10 steps, was applied
for the treatment of short-range electrostatic and van der
Waals interactions with potentials shifted to zero at 1.4 nm.
The latter were modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential. Analytic
dispersion corrections were applied for energy and
pressure calculation. Long-range electrostatic interactions
were treated with the smooth particle-mesh Ewald (PME)
method using a real-space cut-off of 1.4 nm with
a cubic splines interpolation scheme and a grid spacing of
0.12 nm. The center of mass translation of the computational box was removed
every 100 steps. All bond lengths were constrained using
the LINCS algorithm.

The free energy change from the alchemical perturbation
was calculated using the MBAR method. Non-binding guest
molecules were indicated with a binding free energy of 0.0 kcal/mol.

A sound error estimate for the predicted free energies was 
not conducted, as only one binding pose per complex was investigated.
As a result, the estimated binding free energies may change substantially 
if the system is reconsidered in future work.
