Method:

This submission was created by MA with corrected prediction values per the request of the Voelz lab. This submission includes corrections to their ranked submission, as described by the Voelz lab below:

"Our Expanded Ensemble simulations had sissues while turnig off the restraints. To account for this, we computed free energy corrections by sampling additional restraint strengths, then used MBAR for computing the corrections terms."

"G5 is an outlier from the corrected predictions. We observe a transisition state in G5, where G5 flips through the center of the host, which is an artifact from the doublely decoupling methohd alongside our center of mass restraints."

THE FOLLOWING METHOD DESCRIPTION IS FROM THE ORIGINAL RANKED SUBMISSION.

Absolute binding free energies for host-guest interactions were calculated using a double-decoupling method in which the alchemical free energies of decoupling the guest in the presence and absence of the host were computed using expanded-ensemble molecular simulations performed on the Folding@home distributed computing platform.  A  three-part workflow was implemented to (1) prepare systems, (2) perform expanded ensemble simulations on Folding@home and Temple University high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, and (3) analyze the results.
\subsection{System preparation}
\paragraph{Microstate enumeration}
Curve fits of WP6 fluorescence emission spectra vs pH published in Yu et al. (Figures S16 and S17) \cite{yu2012water} suggest a pKa of 6.997 and a Hill coefficient of 3.519, for a model where approximately 4 protons cooperatively dissociate upon varying the pH from 2 to 11.  Based on this result, and the absence of other information, we assume that the most populated microstate of WP6 at pH 7.4 has a -12 net charge, and that titration to lower pH coopertatively adds 4 protons to form  a -8 net charge state.  Therefore, we considered three different protonation states of the WP6 host: -12, -10, -8 net charge, each with equal numbers of deprotonated groups above and below the pillarene ring, as the host microstates likely contributing most in the binding reaction.
Reference ionization states for each guest molecule were determined by OpenEye's Quacpac module \cite{QUACPAC}, which selected the most energetically favorable ionization state at pH 7.4. While the reference state is likely to have the greatest population, we additionally considered a larger ensemble of enumerated microstates that may be populated near pH 7.4.  This resulted in between 1 and 4 microstates per guest molecule. We also considered each enantiomer of chiral guest molecules as separate microstates.
\paragraph{Simulation preparation}
System preparation was performed using our in-house \verb|simulation_prep| module.  Force field parameters for the hosts and guests used OpenFF-2.0.0. \cite{jeff_wagner_2021_5214478, lim2020benchmark} The only exception to this was for the guest G4 containing a silane group for which OpenFF parameters were unavailable.  We instead used GAFF-2.11 \cite{wang2006automatic} for G4.  Partial charges were assigned using AM1-BCC \cite{jakalian2002fast}.
Initial poses for receptor-ligand systems were prepared by docking guests to the host via OpenEye's OEDocking\cite{OEDocking} module using the FRED score function\cite{mcgann2011fred} and saving the minimum-energy structure. Systems were solvated with TIP3P water and neutralizing counterions at 137 mM NaCl .  Ligand-only simulations used a 3.5 nm cubic box, while receptor-ligand simulations used a 4.5 nm cubic box.  Ligand-only simulations were minimized and equilibrated at 298.15 K using GPU-accelerated OpenMM version 7.5.0 \cite{eastman2017openmm}. Receptor-ligand were minimized and equilibrated at 298.15 K in Gromacs version 2020.3 \cite{abraham2015gromacs} using position restraints with a force constant of 800 kJ mol$^{-1}$ nm$^{-2}$ all heavy atoms of the host, and all atoms of the guest. Equilibration was performed in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble.
\subsection{Expanded Ensemble simulations}
Absolute binding free energies computed using expanded-ensemble (EE) methods have been used previously in SAMPL challenges, \cite{monroe2014converging,rizzi2020sampl6} and our methods closely follow these efforts, with some innovations inspired by recent work \cite{zhang2021expanded}.
The free energy $\Delta G_L$ of decoupling the guest from solvent in a ligand-only (L) simulation was calculated using 101 alchemical intermediates in which Coulomb interactions are turned off, and then van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The free energy $\Delta G_{RL}$ of decoupling the guest from a receptor-ligand (RL) simulation was calculated using 101 alchemical intermediates in which a  restraint potential is turned \textit{on}, then Coulomb interactions are turned off, and then vdW interactions.  The restraint potential was a harmonic distance restraint between the center of mass of the six benzene rings of the WP6 host (6 rings $\times$ 6 carbons = 36 atoms), and all non-hydrogen guest atoms, with a force constant of 800 kJ mol$^{-1}$ nm$^{-2}$, and an equilibrium distance of 0 nm.  The absolute free energy of binding $\Delta G$ is estimated as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta G = \Delta G_{\text{rest}} + \Delta G_L - \Delta G_{RL},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta G_{\text{rest}}$ is the free energy cost of restraining the guest from standard volume to a restricted volume, determined by the force constant 800 kJ mol$^{-1}$ nm$^{-2}$, which we compute to be $\Delta G_1$ = +6.42 $RT$.  The $-\Delta G_{RL}$ term includes the free energy of removing this restaint.
\paragraph{Optimization of alchemical intermediates}
In order to avoid sampling bottlenecks in the EE algorithm that would impede the efficient exploration of all alchemical intermediates, we implemented a custom optimization scheme (Zhang et al., in preparation) that uses a steepest-descent algorithm to minimize the variance in the distributions $P(\Delta u_{kl})$, where $\Delta u_{kl}$ is the change in (reduced) energy in going from thermodynamic ensemble $k$ to ensemble $l$. This has the effect of maximizing the EE transition probabilities.
Each L and RL system (using the -12 charge state of the host)  was run for 24 hours in order to sample $\Delta u_{kl}$ distributions over the course of an EE simulation, using an initial guess for the schedule of $\lambda$-values that control the alchemical transformation.  From this information, optimized $\lambda$-values were obtained and used for production-run EE simulations on the Folding@home distributed computing platform \cite{zimmerman2021sars}.
For each set of host-guest microstate pairs, fifty parallel production-run EE simulations were performed in GROMACS 2020.3.  Simulations used a timestep of 2 fs, 0.9 nm cutoffs for long-range electrostatics, LINCS constraints on H-bonds, with frames were saved every 50 ps. The Wang-Landau method and Metropolized-Gibbs move set was used for EE simulations.  The initial Wang-Landau (WL) bias increment was set to 10 $k_BT$, and was scaled by a factor of 0.8 every time the histogram of sampled intermediates was sufficiently flat.  Settings from an \texttt{.mdp} file taken from an RL simulation are shown below:

% In *some* simulations, we observed irreversible binding of sodium cations to the interior of the host (G4/2). G8 was only prepared for the fully de-protonated receptor and ligand-only systems (\verb|RL_12/L|), as the other protonation states were problematic during setup.

\subsection{Analysis}
The convergence of the EE predictions was monitored by the progressive decrease of the Wang-Landau (WL) increment.  We considered the EE simulations to be sufficiently converged if the WL increment went below 0.01 and 0.02 for the L and RL simulations, respectively.  Free energies  were computed as the average of all free energy estimates reported after the convergence threshold was reached, across all converged trajectories.  In the case that less than five trajectories reached convergence according to our criteria, the five (or more) trajectories with the smallest WL increments were used to compute the average free energy.
Uncertainties in our computed binding free energies $\Delta G$ (in units of $RT$) come from the standard deviations of computed $\Delta G_L$ and $\Delta G_{RL}$ values across multiple parallel simulations.
\subsubsection{Binding free energy predictions consider the full set of host and guest microstates.}
Our final ranked predictions of the absolute binding free energy $\Delta G$ for each host-guest interaction (in units $RT$) are computed as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta G =  -\ln \frac{\sum_{i \in \text{bound}} e^{-\Delta G_i} }{\sum_{i \in \text{unbound}} e^{-\Delta G_i} },
\end{equation}
where each $\Delta G_i$ are bound- and unbound-microstate free energies.  Free energy differences relating bound and unbound microstates are provided by the double decoupling EE free energy simulations.  Free energy differences relating protonation states of the WP6 host were given by our model of cooperative titration of 4 protons at pH 6.997.  At pH 7.4, this model rewards the removal of two protons by -1.856 $RT$.  Free energy differences between the protonation microstates of the guests are provided by microstate pKa estimates  obtained using the \texttt{luoszgroup} $pK_a$ predictor from Qi Yang et al. \cite{yang2020holistic}.
We also submitted two additional unranked submissions.  One included all samples of the free energy estimates throughout the simulations, regardless of the WL convergence.  The other used only the -8 net charge microstate of the host.
Model uncertainties $\sigma_{\text{model}}$ were calculated as
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\text{model}} = \left( \sigma_{\Delta G}^2 +  \sigma_{\text{sys}}^2  \right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\text{sys}} = 0.6857 RT$ is assumed to be independent systematic error arising from the reported 1.7 kJ mol$^{-1}$ accuracy of OpenFF 2.0.0 \cite{jeff_wagner_2021_5214478}.
An interactive webpage of all EE simulations (WL increment over time and estimated free energy over time, for all alchemical transformations) and our computed binding free estimates is available at \url{https://vvoelz.github.io/sampl9-voelzlab/}.
