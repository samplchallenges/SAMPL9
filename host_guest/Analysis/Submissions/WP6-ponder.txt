Method:
We have computed absolute binding free energies for all the WP6 host-guest
systems via explicit solvent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using
a standard double decoupling protocol and the polarizable atomic multipole
AMOEBA force field. All simulations were performed with the Tinker8 and
Tinker9 software running on CPUs and GPUs, respectively. All calculations
used the AMOEBA force field. AMOEBA parameters were generated manually by
members of the Ponder lab, or via the AMOEBA FORGE parameterization engine
developed by Chris Ho in collaboration with the Ponder lab. Our standard
parameterization protocols and guidelines from the published literature
were followed. Each guest was modeled as a either a mono-cation or di-cation
as appropriate. The WP6 host was parameterized as all carboxylates and with
a total charge of -12. A 1:1 stoichiometry was assumed for each complex.

For each guest, a series of MD simulations were performed starting from the
guest in water (solvation leg) and from the host-guest complex in water
(host-guest leg). In both legs a series windows were used to first annihilate
electrostatics in the guest, followed by decoupling of guest vdw interactions.
The calculations were performed on initial 50 Ang cubic systems under the NPT
ensemble, and with twelve chloride ions added to the solvation simulations
to match the net charge of the host in the host-guest simulations. All of the
simulations used PME for long range electrostatics, and a 9 Ang cutoff on vdw
terms incremented by an isotropic vdw long range correction. A two-stage
RESPA-style integrator was used for the MD with a 2 fs outer time step. MD
trajectory snapshots were saved every 1 ps. For host-guest MD windows, a
single flat-bottomed harmonic distance restraint between groups of atoms
was used to maintain binding of the guest. These restraints were chosen such
that they were not violated during unrestrained simulations runs on the bound
host-guest complex.

Each sampling window was simulated for 10 ns and the initial 1 ns was
discarded as equilibration. The production simulations beyond the initial
1 ns were then analyzed using the standard BAR method between adjacent
windows to compute free energy differences. The difference between the
sum of the solvation and host-guest legs, after analytical correction of
the host-guest sum for release of the flat-bottomed harmonic restraint,
was taken as the binding energy estimate. Statistical error was estimated
for each BAR calculation, using the analytical formula suggested in Bennett's
original paper on the BAR method. These errors were combined to get a total
statistical error for each overall binding free energy prediction.

Alternative binding poses were explored via initial simulations or full
binding free energy calculations for some guests. For guests 3 and 12,
which are chiral, we computed the binding energy of each guest enantiomer to
a single enantiomer of the host. For both of these guests the binding free
energy was similar for the two stereoisomers, and we have chosen to report
the value for the tighter binding stereoisomer.
