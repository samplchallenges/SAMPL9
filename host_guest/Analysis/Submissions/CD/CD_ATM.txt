# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.

Method:
The participants in the Gallicchio lab include Sheenam Khuttan, Solmaz Azimi and Joe Wu. 
Standard binding free energies were computed using the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01129) using the ATMMetaForce plugin (https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/openmm-atmmetaforce-plugin) with the OpenMM 7.6.0 MD engine.
Force field parameters were assigned to the hosts and the guests using an in-house development ffengine workflow at Roivant Discovery.
Fixed partial charges were derived from GFN2-xTB/BCC with bond charge correction (BCC) parameters fitted to the HF/6-31G* ESP with COSMO implicit solvation model from a 50,000 drug like compounds dataset.
The initial structures were prepared in academic Maestro with the guests manually docked into the hosts. 
The systems were assembled using tleap in AmberTools, using TIP3P water and 75 mM NaCl.
Each complex was energy minimized and thermalized at 300 K and 1 bar.
For each host, we combined the absolute binding free energy (ABFE) of trans-4-methylcyclohexanol with the relative binding free energy (RBFE) of protonated PMZ relative to trans-4-methylcyclohexanol to obtain the ABFE of protonated PMZ.
We then collected the RBFE values of the other guests relative to protonated PMZ to derive their ABFE estimates.
We have analyzed all possible combinations of bound poses, chirality, and protonation states of the ligands and used the weighted sum of the corresponding binding constants to obtain the binding affinity predictions above. 
MD at 300 K at constant volume with Hamiltonian replica exchange was used for conformational sampling. 
Convergence was monitored by inspecting the ABFE estimates for symmetric ligands started in different poses. The model uncertainty reported above reflects the observed scatter. 
Free energy estimates and uncertainties were obtained using UWHAM; SEM values are reported at the 2-sigma level.

# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Alchemical`, `Quantum`, `Other Physical` `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
