Method:

All simulations were performed using the attach-pull-release method (10.1002/jcc.23398, 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405) 
with pAPRika 1.0.4, and OpenMM 7.4.2 as the simulation engine. Fifteen windows were used for the attach phase, 
and the 46 umbrella sampling windows during the pull phase were spaced at 0.4 Angstrom intervals, starting at 6 Angstroms 
from the noninteracting anchor particles and extended to a maximum distance of 24 Angstroms. Fifteen windows were used 
for the release phase. Each window included up to 30 ns simulation time. 

The starting structures were obtained by docking using oedock from OpenEye Toolkits 2019.10.2. Each host guest system were solvated
with 2500 TIP3P water molecules in a rectangular box whose dimensions were approximately 40 x 40 x 63 cubic Angstroms, sodium
or chloride counterions (with parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614)) were added as needed to neutralize each
host-guest system, and additional NaCl ions were added to obtain experimental conditions of the same ionic strength. AM1BCC
partial atomic charges were generated with oequacpac as implemented with OpenEye Toolkits. The bonded and Lennard-Jones
parameters were assigned based on OpenFF v1.2.0 using the openff-toolkit 10.2. 

The attach-pull-release windows were prepared using pAPRika 1.0.4, which consists of: adding non-interacting anchor particles, 
Boresch-style restraint setup, the addition of solvent and ions, and preparation of OpenMM XML files. 
As described elsewhere (10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405), six restraints (one distance restraint, two angle restraints, and three torsional
restraints) were used to position the host relative to the anchor particles throughout the entire APR process to impose a lab frame 
of reference. Moreover, three restraints were applied to the guest molecule; two for the translation (r and theta) and one for the
orientation (beta). The guest molecule is pulled from host along the reaction coordinate r.
The force constant values used for the host static restraints and the guest orientational restraints were:

distance restraints = 10.0 kcal/mol/A^2
angle and torsional restraints = 100 kcal/mol/rad^2  

Eight "wall" restraints were used to help define the bound state and prevent guest molecules from leaving the host during the 
attach phase. Restraints were set on the guest relative to the host at every first carbon of each carboxylate arm.
The force constant values used for the wall restraints were:

distance restraints = 50 kcal/mol/A^2
angle restraints = 14 kcal/mol/rad^2 

Equilibration was done at a constant temperature of 298.15 K using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency 1.0 ps^-1 
and pressure control provided by the Monte Carlo barostat (1 atm). All systems were minimized up to a maximum of 5000 
and equilibrated for 1ns.  

Production simulations were run up to 30 ns per window at 298.15 K with temperature control using a Langevin thermostat 
with collision frequency 1.0 ps-1 and pressure control provided by the Monte Carlo barostat (at 1 atm). 
Nonbonded interactions were truncated with a 9.0 Angstrom cutoff. At the same time, long-range electrostatics were 
handled with the PME method and an isotropic dispersion correction is used for the long-range Lennard-Jones. The simulation 
time step was set to 4 fs with Hydrogen Mass Repartitioning (HMR). 

All simulations were analyzed with thermodynamic integration (TI) and/or multibennet acceptance ratio (MBAR) estimator approaches.
The SEMs were obtained using block analysis (described in 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405).

We considered protonated (charged) and non-protonated (neutral) variants of the guests for binding free energy predictions. 
For this submission, we report the predictions using the fully protonated (charged) variant of all guests of primary orientations.
