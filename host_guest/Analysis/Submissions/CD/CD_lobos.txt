# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the word "bCD" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.

#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
Parameters for the guests and hosts molecule were obtained using the ParamChem
server. Initial poses were obtained using GalaxyDock. Each system was solvated in
a box containing TIP3 water with sodium and chloride ions to neutralize the
system's total charge. Box dimension was approximately 57x57x57 Angstroms in
all cases.

For each guest-host couple and each guest, 17 alchemical windows were used to
compute DDM free energies. Each started with 1 ns equilibration in the NVT
ensemble followed by 15 ns of production run, using a Langevin thermostat and a
friction constant of 5.0 ps-1 at 298.15 K.

For the bCD guest-host systems, a restraining flat-bottom, harmonic potential
was used between the center of masses of the guest and the host systems, acting
for distances higher than 5.5 Angstroms and with a 1.5 kCal.mol-1.A-1 force
constant. The h-bCD guest-host systems were treated following the same
procedure, but using a kick-off distance of 12.5 Angstroms. 
This restraint's contribution to the binding free energy was computed using the
FEP method.

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Alchemical`, `Quantum`, `Other Physical` `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
