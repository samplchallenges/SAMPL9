Method:

The host and guest PDB structures were taken from the
GitHub site with no change of the protonation state. For the WP6, the pKa of WP6 are estimated from
the statistical factor formula [D. D. Perrin, Boyd Dempsey and E. P. Serjeant. (1981). Molecular
Factors that Modify pKa Values. In pKa Prediction for Organic Acids and Bases
(16â€“17). Netherlands:Springer ]:

pka(n) = pka(1) - log((n)/(13-n))

Where pka(1) is the pka of the template monobasic acid 2-(2,5-dimethylphenoxy) acetic acid with
canonical SMILES: CC1=CC(=C(C=C1)C)OCC(=O)O. Assuming that pKa(1)=3.23 (Scifinder, predicted value),
we obtain that, at pH=7.4, the prevalent species is the 12- anion with all deprotonated group (
97\%).

The method, virtual Double System Single Box (vDSSB), is described in Ref.
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00634. Briefly, vDSSB is a nonequilibrium
unidirectional alchemical technique, with enhanced sampling of the bound(ligand fully coupled) and
unbound (ligand fully decoupled) end states by torsional tempering (see,
e.g. https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/cp/c9cp02808k )

Enhanced sampling of the equilibrium end-states: In the bound state, the distance between the COM of
the ligand and host is restrained using an harmonic potential with a force constant of 0.052
kcal/mol (corresponding to an allowance volume of ~800 Angs^3).  We run for a total of 48 ns and 16
ns (target state) for the bound and unbound end-states, respectively.  For the bound state we run
batteries of 16-replicas HREM simulations with maximum torsional temperature of 3000 K. The the
unbound state we run batteries of 8-replicas HREM simulations with maximum torsional temperature of
3000 K. The scaling protocol along the replicas is described in Ref. DOI: 10.1002/jcc.21388.

Nonequilibrium alchemical process: We used 360 noneq runs for the bound state each lasting 1.44, and
480 runs for the unbound state of 0.36 ns time span. The final vDSSB DG value is computed by
combining the 360 bound and 420 unbound work values as W_vdssb =W_b+W_u, obtaining 172800 work data
for the convolution distribution P_b(W)*P_u(W) of the (v)DSSB process. In the switch-off (bound)
process, ligand charges are turned off first (intramol no) followed by the LJ interactions with a
soft-core regularization. The switch-on process is done with an inverted protocol.

General: All MD runs (equilibrium of nonequilibrium) were done in NPT ensemble (Parrinello-Rahman
Lagrangian) at T=300 K and p=1 atm with cubic periodic boundary conditions.  Only X-H bonds were
constrained and we used the MTS integrator described in DOI: 10.1063/1.477136.  The host and guest
potential ancd charges were assigned using PrimaDORAC (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00145),
based on the GAFF2 parameterization and AM1/BCC atomic charges.  Water was described using the OPC3
model.  The systems were neutralized by a way a uniform background plasma ( DOI: 10.1063/1.477788).
The BOX size was ~ 35x35x35 Angs^3 in the bound state and 25x25x25 Angs^3 in the unbound state.

Blind predictions: the final DG values are corrected by a term due to the net charge on the ligand
DG_q (see http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10822-018-0151-9) and by the volume term
DG_vol=-0.6log(V_site/V_0) where V_0 is the standard state volume and V_site is computed from the
COM-COM distance distribution in the equilibrium run of the bound state as V_site = 4/3 \pi
(2\sigma^3) with sigma^2 being the variance of the distance distribution:

DG= DG_vDSSB +DG_vol + DG_q

Pre-assessment: prior to submission, vDSSB was tested on the following complexes with known
association constant:

WP6- G13            DG=-8.48    https://doi.org/10.3390/polym9120719
WP6-Methylene-Blue  DG= -9.68   https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/cc/c8cc02739k
WP6-M1              DG= -8.37   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142521000317
WP6-M2              DG= -10.59   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142521000317
WP6-choline         DG= -6.48    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400517315708
WP6-Betaine          no binding  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400517315708

yielding (for exp-calc *dissociation* free energies) 
Pearson=0.80; a= 0.77; b= 4.06; MUE=2.91; tau=0.64; MSE=-2.38

Nota Bene: dissociation free energies data refer to the equilibrium

WP6(-12)-Guest = WP6(-12) + Guest

Given the negative MSE found in the pre-assessment, we expect a consistent overestimation (in the
order of 2-3 kcal/mol) of the submitted BFE, possibly due the presence of protonated WP6 species at
ph=7.4.  

All calculations were done with the orac code (http://www1.chim.unifi.it/orac/ ) on the CRESCO6-ENEA
cluster in Portici (see https://www.eneagrid.enea.it/Resources/CRESCO_documents/CRESCO/Sezione6.html
for details on the architecture)
