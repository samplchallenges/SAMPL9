# Results for WP6
#
# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the word "WP6" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.
#
#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
All MD simulations were performed with the pmemd.cuda program from
AMBER18, then in-house programs/scripts were used for MM-PBSA 
calculation and ELIE fitting.

Each MD simulation last for 100 ns time. The bonded and initial Lennard-Jones
parameters were obtained from GAFF2. Partial atomic charges were
generated with out newly developed ABCG2 methods.
Sodium or chloride counterions, were added only as needed to
neutralize the total charge of each host-guest system; no additional
counterions were added. The starting structures were obtained by
docking from Glide initially, but were relaxed through short preliminary
MD simulations. Each system was solvated with ~1900 TIP3P waters in an
orthorhombic box whose dimensions were approximately 43 x 43 x 43
cubic Angstroms.

Production simulations were run in the NPT ensemble, with temperature
control using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequency 5.0 ps-1
and pressure control provided by the default barostat. Direct
space nonbonded interactions were truncated with a 10.0 Angstrom cutoff,
whereas long-range electrostatics were handled with the PME method,
using default AMBER settings. SHAKE constraints were applied to bonds
involving hydrogen, and the simulation time step was set to 2 fs.

# METHOD CATEGORY SECTION
#
# State which method category your prediction method is better described as:
# `Alchemical`, `Quantum`, `Other Physical` `Empirical`, `Mixed`, or `Other`.
# Pick only one category label.
# The `Category:` keyword is required.
Category:
Other Physical
#
# All submissions must either be ranked or non-ranked.
# Only one ranked submission per participant is allowed.
# Multiple ranked submissions from the same participant will not be judged.
# Non-ranked submissions are accepted so we can verify that they were made before the deadline.
# The "Ranked:" keyword is required, and expects a Boolean value (True/False)
Ranked:
True
