# NCATS NanoLuc Experimental Data

This contains input information for the SAMPL9 NanoLuc Challenge, from NCATS, as detailed in the [challenge description](../README.md).

Tranche 1 of the compounds will form the basis of Phase 1 of the SAMPL9 NanoLuc challenge. A reduced selection (those which bind) will be used for Phase 2. Tranche 2 will be reserved for the SAMPL10 NanoLuc Challenge. 

## Manifest
- `nanoluc_compounds_tranche1.csv`: Tranche 1 of compounds for which to predict NanoLuc binding. Contains compound IDs and isomeric SMILES. Predictions should be of whether compounds do or do not bind with detection thresholds as specified in the challenge description.
- `nanoluc_compounds_tranche2.csv`: Tranche 2 of compounds for which to predict NanoLuc binding. Contains compound IDs and isomeric SMILES. Predictions should b
e of whether compounds do or do not bind with detection thresholds as specified
in the challenge description.

## Additional information forthcoming
- Additional inputs coming, such as an SDF files with conformers, and annotation of which compounds have unspecified stereochemistry (and thus were tested as a racemic mixture)
- Experimental results will be released after phases close
